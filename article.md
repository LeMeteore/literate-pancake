# I. background and rationale
In the hospital, healthcare pactitioner use a health information system to collect patient data like his identity,
age, higth, weigth and biological informations about his diseases. To have a overview of those information, the statistician
must extract patient data and go to an other system like STATA, R or Python to analyse data and send knowledge to practitioner.

during the collect to detect aberration and take decision quickly. This is our question of reseach.
