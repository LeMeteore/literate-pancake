# Abstracts
# I. Introduction
In the hospital, healthcare pactitioner use a health information system to collect patient data like his identity,
age, higth, weigth and biological informations about his diseases. To have a overview of those information, the statistician
must extract patient data and go to an other system like STATA, R or Python to analyse data and send knowledge to practitioner.
To improve the patient automatic follow up, we need a system which will allow practitoner to follow one patient or many patients
during the collect to detect aberration and take decision quickly. This is our question of reseach.

# II. Aims
## II.1. Main aim
#### Implement a user interface which will help physician to collect and visualize patient data by usin python GUI Tkinter

## II.2. Specifics aims
#### II.2.1. Improve the the taking care of patient by allowing automatique analysing of patient data
#### II.2.2. Reduce the rate of aberration during patient data collection
# III. Methods and materials
## III.1. Methods
The taking care of patients is made by interrogation of patient, physical exam and the proposition of treament.
When the patient arrived to hospital at emercency room, the practitioners will

## III.2. Materials
We use Unified Modeling Language (UML) for describing and design the process of patient taking care by physician in inpatient room.
Mysql will be used to store data which are collected by the system.
