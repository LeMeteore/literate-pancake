# background and rationale
In the hospital, healthcare pactitioner use a health information system to collect patient data like his identity,
age, higth, weigth and biological informations about this diseases. To have a overview of those information, the statistician
must extract patient data and go to an other system like STATA, R or Python to analyse data and send knowledge to practitioner.
To improve the patient automatic follow up, we need a system which will allow practitoner to follow one patient or many patients
during the collect to detect aberration and take decision quickly. This is our question of reseach.

# Aim
Implement a user interface which will help physician to collect and visualize patient data by usin python GUI Tkinter

# Method

# Expected results


```python
# module foo.py

a = 42

def bar(x):
    print(x)
```
